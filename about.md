InterVarsity Christian Fellowship/USA is a vibrant campus ministry that establishes and advances witnessing communities of students and faculty. We minister to all through small group Bible studies, large campus gatherings, leadership training, thoughtful discipleship, and life-changing conferences and events.

In one accord with all Christians on campus, we have a vision to see Carnegie Mellon University become a place where Jesus’ name is lifted on high and glorified.
