InterVarsity Christian Fellowship/USA is a vibrant campus ministry that establishes and advances witnessing communities of students and faculty. We minister to all through <a href="https://www.cmuintervarsity.org/smallgroups.html">small group</a> Bible studies, <a href="https://www.cmuintervarsity.org/largegroup.html">large campus gatherings</a>, leadership training, thoughtful discipleship, and life-changing conferences and events.

In one accord with all Christians on campus, we have a vision to see Carnegie Mellon University become a place where Jesus’ name is lifted on high and glorified.
