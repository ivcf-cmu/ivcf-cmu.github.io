<h2>IFA Philly Missions Trip</h2>
<p>
The Inter-fellowship Association at CMU organizes a week-long missions trip to Philadelphia to preach the gospel and spread love to the under-privileged in one of Philly's worst neighborhoods. Christians from many different fellowships will band together to run Vacation Bible School for the urban youth in the afternoon, preach to the homeless and drug addicts at night, and be a light to the Kensington community for a whole week.

Natalie Harmon and David White will be leading the trip during Spring Break 2018! For more information, contact either of them.
