        <h2>MAC</h2>
        <p>
        Spanning two separate weekends, MAC (Ministering Across Cultures) is a
        resourceful training ground for students who desire to learn cross
        culture ministries and/or to relate to people of other ethnicities,
        background and culture. A great eye-opener and preparation especially
        for students who intend to go on short- or long-term missions and
        cross-cultural ministries.

        <p>
        Spend your summer living and serving among the poorest of the poor,
