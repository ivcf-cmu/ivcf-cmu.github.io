<p>
  <b>Large Group</b> is a weekly event where all of the small groups gather in
  one place to worship God through music, know Him better through scripture,
  have fellowship with one another, and be ignited and uplifted by the Holy
  Spirit. Large Group is a time of community, to meet God together as one body,
  in one accord. After Large Group, it is an InterVarsity tradition to get
  dinner together afterwards and socialize. Come join us, and bring friends!
