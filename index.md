        Welcome to InterVarsity Christian Fellowship! We are a community of students at Carnegie Mellon University who
        strive to know God and make Him known.
    </p>

    <p>
        With CMU finally moving back into in-person, IVCF will also prayfully begin in-person activities! Yay!
    </p>

    <p>
        In conjunction with CMU's Inter-Fellowship Association, we have
        many events going on during orientation week which you may want
        to check out! For IV-specific events, check out our <a href="events.html">events</a> page here!
    </p>

    <!-- <p>
    While we usually love connecting in person, in light of COVID-19 all of our events are virtual. That said, we are still excited to encounter Christ and all of the people he has created. Come join us for Bible study, large group, or other events!
    </p>
     -->
