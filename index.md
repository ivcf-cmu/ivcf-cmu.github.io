    Welcome to InterVarsity Christian Fellowship! We are a 
    community of students at Carnegie Mellon University who love 
    God, and we want to share His love with you!

    In conjunction with CMU's Inter-Fellowship Association, we have
    many events going on during orientation week which you may want
    to check out!  Head over to IFA's
    <a href="http://www.christatcmu.com/">website</a>
    to see them all.
